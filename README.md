**CryptoPass** is an advanced, local-first password manager and cryptographic suite designed for high-security environments. Distinct from cloud-based alternatives, it operates entirely offline with a zero-knowledge architecture, ensuring your secrets are decrypted **only in volatile memory** and never touch your disk.

## 🛡️ Critical Security Features (v4.0.0)

### 🧠 RAM-Only Architecture
Unlike standard password managers that may leave temporary files, CryptoPass v4.0 uses **SQLite Deserialization** to decrypt your vault directly from the encrypted container into RAM.
- **No Temporary Files**: Unencrypted data never touches the filesystem (not even in `%TEMP%`).
- **Aggressive Cleanup**: Triggered garbage collection (`gc.collect`) on vault lock/exit.

### 🔐 Defense-in-Depth
- **Full-File Encryption**: The entire database (`vault.db`) is an AES-256-GCM encrypted container.
- **Argon2id Hashing**: State-of-the-art memory-hard key derivation to resist GPU brute-force attacks.
- **Hardware Binding**: Optional session persistence is cryptographically bound to your specific device hardware ID.
- **Strict Session Policy**: "Stay Logged In" sessions are **PIN-gated** and expire automatically after **24 hours** (configurable).

## ✨ Capabilities

### 🔑 Credential Vault
- **Organized Storage**: Bank-grade encryption for passwords, usernames, URLs, and notes.
- **Smart Generation**: Generate high-entropy passwords (up to 128 chars) with custom rules.
- **Strength Meter**: Real-time analysis of password complexity and reuse risks.
- **Visual Privacy**: Global "Eye" toggles used by default for all sensitive fields.

### 📝 Secure Note-Taker
- **Encrypted Docs**: Write sensitive notes in Markdown with live preview.
- **Blob Storage**: Securely attach files and images (`blobs.db`) directly into your encrypted notes.
- **Auto-Save**: Changes are encrypted and committed instantly.

### 📜 Cryptographic Lab
- **Key Generation**: Create expert-grade keys without external tools:
  - **RSA** (2048/4096-bit)
  - **Ed25519**
  - **SSH Keys** (OpenSSH format)
  - **Certificates** (X.509 Self-Signed)
- **Key Vault**: dedicated secure storage for your private keys and certificates.

### ⚡ Modern Experience
- **Premium UI**: Built with `CustomTkinter` for a seamless dark-mode experience.
- **Quick Unlock**: Use a 4-8 digit PIN for rapid access on trusted devices.
- **Portability**: Fully self-contained "Portable Mode" support via custom data paths.
- **Backup System**: Create encrypted `.cpback` archives for safe off-site storage.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10** or higher (Required for `sqlite3.deserialize`).

### Manual Install
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptopass.git
   cd cryptopass
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash

   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### First Run
1. **Master Password**: You will be prompted to set a strong Master Password. This is the **only** way to recover your vault.
2. **Recovery Mnemonic**: A 24-word BIP-39 phrase will be generated. **Write this down.** It bypasses all other security layers if you lose your password.
3. **Security Setup**: You will be asked to configure:
   - **Everyday Password**: A separate password for daily login (wraps the Master Key).
   - **Quick PIN**: A fast unlock code for this specific device.

### Migration
Moving to a new PC?
1. Go to **Settings > Migration**.
2. Generate a **Transfer Key**.
3. Copy the `vault.db` (and `blobs.db`) to the new machine.
4. On the new machine, launch CryptoPass. It will detect the hardware mismatch and ask for the Transfer Key.

## 🏗️ Building Executable
To create a standalone `.exe` for Windows:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=assets/icon.ico --name "CryptoPass" main.py
```
*(No separate installation required for end-users)*
