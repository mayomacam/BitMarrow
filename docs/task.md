## ✅ Milestone 1: Core Foundation & Certificate Vault - v1.1.0/v1.2.0 (Completed)
- [x]- **Entropy Check**: Score at least "Good"- **UI Logic**: Standardized `StrengthMeter` and `CTkImage` rendering paths.
- **KeyGen Fix**: Fixed packing order and visibility issues in `KeyGenFrame`.
- **UI Accessibility**: Implemented `ScrollableFrame` for setup and security dialogs.
 error
- [x] **UI Polish**: Implemented ScrollableFrame for setup; Fixed KeyGen options packing
- [x] **Privacy UI**: Implement "Show/Hide" toggles for private keys in Generator & Vault
- [x] **Label Fix**: Standardize "Public Key" vs "Private Key" naming (removed confusing "Secret" suffix)
- [x] **Security Logic**: Enhanced password strength meter with sequence heuristics and "Excellent" (100%) tier scaling
- [x] **DB Upgrade**: Added certificate metadata and expiry schema
- [x] **Versioning**: Established `CHANGELOG.md` and bumped to v1.2.0 (Security Hardened)
- [x] **Cert Logic**: Implemented X.509 parsing and enhanced generation
- [x] **UI**: Launched the dedicated "📜 Key Vault" management interface

## ✅ Milestone 2: Hardened Security & Performance (Completed)
- [x] **Full DB Encryption**: Implemented AES-256-GCM file-level encrypted containers
- [x] **Hardware-Linked Sessions**: Secure session persistence with Windows Credential Manager
- [x] **Quick Access PIN**: 4-8 digit hardware-bound PIN for rapid unlocking
- [x] **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive internal tracking of security events
- [x] **OWASP 2023 KDF**: Updated Argon2id parameters (64MB, 3 iterations)
- [x] **Schema Migration**: Automatic database upgrades for legacy vault files
- [x] **Settings UI**: Integrated security management console

---

## ✅ Milestone 3: Hardened Authentication & Secure Storage (v3.0.0 Completed)
- [x] **Enforced Security**: Mandatory setup of PIN and Everyday Password upon login.
- [x] **Advanced Credentials**: New settings to change Master Password, PIN, and Everyday Password.
- [x] **Secure Blobs**: Created `blobs.db` for encrypted file storage (integrated with Notes).
- [x] **Encrypted Backups**: Implemented `.cpback` migration archives locked with Transfer Key.
- [x] **Configurable Paths**: Added Settings UI for custom data/backup directories.
- [x] **Vault Re-Keying**: Master Password change now triggers full DB re-encryption.

---

## ✅ Milestone 4: Critical Audit & Hardening (v4.0.0 Completed)
- [x] **In-Memory DB**: Implemented `sqlite3.deserialize` for RAM-only database operation.
- [x] **Security Audit**: Addressed all findings from `SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
- [x] **Garbage Collection**: Aggressive `gc.collect` on lock/exit.
- [x] **Session Policy**: Implemented 24h max session duration with configurable slider.
- [x] **Migration**: Moved from temp-file decryption to purely in-memory decryption.

---

## ⚡ Future Roadmap (Milestone 5)
- [ ] **Auto-Lock Triggers**: Lock on system sleep/lid close.
- [ ] **E2E Cloud Sync**: Secure, client-side encrypted synchronization.
- [ ] **Mobile Companion**: Preliminary research for mobile vault access.
